# Intro to Telecommunications - an open-source project!
## Introduction - What is my project?
My project idea for the final project of our extra computer class is a github repo which can be used to learn the basics of telecommunications as a highschool student. Of course, there are a bunch of other places online where you can learn the basic physics behind telecommunications and how certain devices like walkie-talkies or pagers or telegraphs work. However, a lot of these websites are incredibly difficult to understand, especially with just a highschool level of basic maths and physics. Additionally, these websites only dive into a specific part of science which CAN be important for the subject of telecommunications (e.g. wave physics, linear algebra, circuit analysis, electrical engineering, how certain devices work, etc...), though there isn't a website where all these fields are combined to really specifically teach the field of, or atleast the basics of how humans share data over a large distance. I will definately list some websites that teach a subject related to telecommunications in this project. 
But it's important to see this repository as just a summary of all information to this topic online, with some instructions to device I'll be building, NOT as an independant and completely new website. As said, this is mainly aimed at teenagers with just a highschool level understanding of maths and physics. 
The "learning place" will probably be a bunch of interlinked LaTex documents, due to it being easier to insert pictures and formulas into the text.

## Features 
To better explain certain aspects, I plan to build devices to really get a better feel for the subject myself, and also so that I somewhat know what I'm talking about. I plan on building a simple telegraph system and a pager system.

<b>The telegraph:</b>
<br>
The telegraph should be able to have the following things:
<ul>
    <li>Be able to send and receive morse code from one end of a cable to the other</li>
    <li>Give a basic understanding on how information is transferred across a cable.</li>
</ul>
I will probably 3D-print the components such as the send and recieve box for the telegraph. I might even build it out of wood which might even be easier. Nontheless, all instructions I used will get uploaded to this repository. This part of the project will also dive a little bit into the history of telegraph - which is considered a great milestone in long-distance data-transfer. The telgraph works with a simple circuit board. I will NOT be using a microcomputer, as this will defeat the entire purpose of trying to learn telecommunications from scratch - as if it were the 18th century!

<b>The pager:</b>
<br>
The pager should do these things:
<ul>
    <li>Better my understanding on electrical circuits.</li>
    <li>Give an understanding on wireless data transfer.</li>
    <li>Be able to work how a simple pager system should work;
        <ul>
            <li>A station that is used to send information.</li>
            <li>A small device (the actual pager) that can recieve and show the numbers. (I will explain later in more detail how a pager works.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
Same as with the telegraph
