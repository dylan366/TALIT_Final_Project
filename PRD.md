# Intro to Telecommunications - an open-source project!
## Introduction - What is my project?
My project idea for the final project of our extra computer class is a github repo which can be used to learn the basics of telecommunications as a highschool student. Of course, there are a bunch of other places online where you can learn the basic physics behind telecommunications and how certain devices like walkie-talkies or pagers or telegraphs work. However, a lot of these websites are incredibly difficult to understand, especially with just a highschool level of basic maths and physics. Additionally, these websites only dive into a specific part of science which CAN be important for the subject of telecommunications (e.g. wave physics, linear algebra, circuit analysis, electrical engineering, how certain devices work, etc...), though there isn't a website where all these fields are combined to really specifically teach the field of telecommunications. I will definately list some websites that teach a subject related to telecommunications in this project. 
But it's important to see the github repository as a clean summary of all these websites, and not a completely new website. 

## Features 
To better explain certain aspects, I plan to build devices to really get a better feel for the subject myself, and also so that I somewhat know what I'm talking about. I plan on building a simple telegraph system and a pager system.

<b>The telegraph:</b>
<br>
The telegraph should be able to have the following things:
<ul>
    <li>Be able to send and receive morse code from one end of a cable to the other</li>
    <li>Give a basic understanding on how information is transferred across a cable.</li>
</ul>
I will probably 3D-print the components such as the send and recieve box for the telegraph. I might even build it out of wood which might even be easier. Nontheless, all instructions I used will get uploaded to this repository. This part of the project will also dive a little bit into the history of telegraph - which is considered a great milestone in long-distance data-transfer. The telgraph works with a simple circuit board. I will NOT be using a microcomputer, as this will defeat the entire purpose of trying to learn telecommunications from scratch - as if it were the 18th century!

<b>The pager:</b>
<br>
The pager should do these things:
<ul>
    <li>Better my understanding on electrical circuits.</li>
    <li>Give an understanding on wireless data transfer.</li>
    <li>Be able to work how a simple pager system should work;
        <ul>
            <li>A station that is used to send information.</li>
            <li>A small device (the actual pager) that can recieve and show the numbers. (I will explain later in more detail how a pager works.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
Same as with the telegraph
