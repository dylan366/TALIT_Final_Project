# Intro to Telecommunications - an open-source project!
My project idea for the final project of our extra computer class is a github repo which can be used to learn the basics of telecommunications as a highschool student. Of course, there are a bunch of other places online where you can learn the basic physics behind telecommunications and how certain devices like walkie-talkies or pagers or telegraphs work. However, a lot of these websites are incredibly difficult to understand, especially with just a highschool level of basic maths and physics. Additionally, these websites only dive into a specific part of science which CAN be important for the subject of telecommunications (e.g. wave physics, linear algebra, circuit analysis, electrical engineering, how certain devices work, etc...), though there isn't a website where all these fields are combined to really specifically teach the field of telecommunications. I will definately list some websites that teach a subject related to telecommunications in this project. 
But it's important to see the github repository as a clean summary of all these websites, and not a completely new website. 

To better explain certain aspects, I plan to build devices to really get a better feel for the subject myself, and also so that I somewhat know what I'm talking about. I plan on building a simple telegraph system and a pager system.

The telegraph:
The telegraph should be able to have the following things:
