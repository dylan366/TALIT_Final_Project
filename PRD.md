# Intro to Telecommunications - an open-source project!
## Introduction - What is my project?
My project idea for the final project of our extra computer class is a github repo which can be used to learn the basics of telecommunications as a highschool student. Of course, there are a bunch of other places online where you can learn the basic physics behind telecommunications and how certain devices like walkie-talkies or pagers or telegraphs work. However, a lot of these websites are incredibly difficult to understand, especially with just a highschool level of basic maths and physics. Additionally, these websites only dive into a specific part of science which CAN be important for the subject of telecommunications (e.g. wave physics, linear algebra, circuit analysis, electrical engineering, how certain devices work, etc...), though there isn't a website where all these fields are combined to really specifically teach the field of, or atleast the basics of how humans share data over a large distance. I will definately list some websites that teach a subject related to telecommunications in this project. 
But it's important to see this repository as just a summary of all information to this topic online, with some instructions to device I'll be building, NOT as an independant and completely new website. As said, this is mainly aimed at teenagers with just a highschool level understanding of maths and physics. 
The "learning place" will probably be a bunch of interlinked LaTex documents, due to it being easier to insert pictures and formulas into the text.

## Features 
To better explain certain aspects, I plan to build devices to really get a better feel for the subject myself, and also so that I somewhat know what I'm talking about. I plan on building a simple telegraph system and a pager system.

<b>The telegraph:</b>
<br>
The telegraph should be able to have the following things:
<ul>
    <li>Be able to send and receive morse code from one end of a cable to the other</li>
    <li>Give a basic understanding on how information is transferred across a cable.</li>
</ul>
I will probably 3D-print the components such as the send and recieve box for the telegraph. I might even build it out of wood which might even be easier. Nontheless, all instructions I used will get uploaded to this repository. This part of the project will also dive a little bit into the history of telegraph - which is considered a great milestone in long-distance data-transfer. The telgraph works with a simple circuit board. I will NOT be using a microcomputer, as this will defeat the entire purpose of trying to learn telecommunications from scratch - as if it were the 18th century!

<b>The pager:</b>
<br>
The pager should do these things:
<ul>
    <li>Better my understanding on electrical circuits.</li>
    <li>Give an understanding on wireless data transfer.</li>
    <li>Be able to work how a simple pager system should work;
        <ul>
            <li>A station that is used to send information.</li>
            <li>A small device (the actual pager) that can recieve and show the numbers. (I will explain later in more detail how a pager works.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
Same as with the telegraph. (History, how it works, 3D-print, circuit, etc...)

## Technical details
As quickly mentioned above, I believe to get the realest understanding of this topic, I shoudl build the telegraph and pager with the most "natural" stuff if that makes sense. So for the pager, which obviously is much more complex than a telegraph, I'll probably be forced to use pre-built devices such as a transmittor or receiver. However, if the time is planned right and I don't have much to do, a kind of extra addition for me would then be to build a second pager completely by myself - so even building and transmittor and receiver by myself. 

The telegraph does not really need any special components. 

As mentioned above aswell, this will all be pure electronics, so no microcontroller such as an Arduino or Raspberry Pi.


## Predictions:
### Challenges:
I would assume that the actual building will cause a lot of problems. Especially since this entire subject is totally new to me, I will definately run into many problems, be it in the circuit, in the calculations, or in the components. 
Also, not much of a challenge but still very time-consuming, is to scrape together all the existing knowledge of telecommunications off of the internet, teach it to myself, and then repeat it in my own words for this github. 

### Disclaimer:
ChatGPT seems like an excellent way to resolve the second big challenge of teaching myself this very broad field through many different website. However I must definately make sure ChatGPT always gives me sources and I check those sources. But its summarising capabilities will most definately come in handy.
