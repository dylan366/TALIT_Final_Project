# The Radio
## Introduction
After the telegraph, people still weren't satisfied. Sure, you could send messages over long distances in a matter of seconds, but it still wasn't good enough. The telegraph still had many flaws, for example:
- You need to learn the encoding/decoding (Morse code)
- Only really worked over land, except for the transatlantic telegraph line (incredibly expensive by the way)
- Used a lot of materials (Many kilometres of thick copper wire)
- Needed maintenance along the route, sometimes in very rural areas.
  
So as we can see, the telegraph was very quick, but because it needed a wire to send and receive data, it still had many faults. Which is why people started to imagine a wireless method of communicating. That's right, communicating using only air!

## History
As explained in the chapter of history of the Telegraph, many technological discoveries had already been made in the field of electricity and magnetism. 
In 1864, James Clerk Maxwell came up with the theories, that light, x-rays, UV-light and radio were all part of the same spectrum; the electromagnetic spectrum. And in 1886 this was proven by Heinrich Hertz, who managed to create and transmit electromagnetic waves through the air. His waves were named "Hertzian Waves", which is the old term for "radio waves", e.g. waves in the frequency between 1 GHz and 300 GHz. We will look at what any of these words mean soon.
In 1890, Frederick Thomas Trouton and William Crookes came up with the idea, that these long waves could be used in communication and navigation, creating a sort of wireless telegraph. Though, they never built it. Finally, in 1897, Guglielmo Marconi invented the first device that could transmit radio waves up to 3km and the first radio transmission system was invented. 
After setting up a radio system on the Isle of Wight and using a kite to suspend an antenna in the air, Marconi successfully transmitted a message to America. True, the earth's curvature would have been in the way for direct transmission, but radio waves normally bounce off the Ionosphere (48km-965km), meaning they could bounce back and forth all the way to America. 
The history of the radio is obviously much more in depth and complex than this short summary. It deserves its own entire book. To keep it simple, I decided to just note down some important milestones that lead to the invention of the radio system.
