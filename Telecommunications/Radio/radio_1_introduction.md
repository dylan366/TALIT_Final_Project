# The Radio
## Introduction
After the telegraph, people still weren't satisfied. Sure, you could send messages over long distances in a matter of seconds, but it still wasn't good enough. The telegraph still had many flaws, for example:
- You need to learn the encoding/decoding (Morse code)
- Only really worked over land, except for the transatlantic telegraph line.
- Used a lot of materials (Many kilometers of thick copper wire)
- Needed maintenace along the route, sometimes in very rural areas.
So as we can see, the telegraph was very quick, but due to the fact that it needed a wire to send and recieve data, it still had many faults. Hence, why people started to imagine a wireless method of communicating. That's right, communicating using only air!
