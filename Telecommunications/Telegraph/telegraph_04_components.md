# **The components**
This short chapter aims to show you what components were used in the telegraph and how they work independent from the telegraph. 

## The battery
The battery was invented by Alessandro Volta from Italy in 1800. His invention was called "The Voltaic pile". 

### What you need:
- equally as many copper plates and aluminium or zinc plates. For the copper I used 1 Cent coins and for the Aluminium I used aluminium foil cut into circles the same size as the 1 Cent coins.
- Paper or Felt circles (same size as the coins and foil again). I used felt. 
- Some Water with a teaspoon of Salt in a small cup
- 2 cables
- Optional: A plastic tube to keep everything in place

### Instructions:
#### Step 1

Dip the felt in salt water until they are covered. 

#### Step 2

Lay out all the material and quickly let the felt dry for a minute or two. They don't have to dry completely, keep them slightly moist.

#### Step 3

Stack the material in the following order: Copper, felt, aluminium. I used a plastic tube with holes on both sides as an aid. 

#### Step 4

Add more of these piles above eachother. Do not seperate them, just add the copper right on top of the last aluminium and continue. Also, connect the first copper with a cable or any other conductive material. I just used a bit of solder.  

#### Step 5

Connect the last aluminium with a cable too. This time I used a proper cable.

#### Step 6

After following the previous steps you should have something that looks like this. Now you have a working battery and can connect the two cable to whatever you want, as if it were a real battery. The copper side is the positive and the aluminium side is the negative. 

#### Step 7

Now we can measure the voltage in our battery. We had 3 piles and the multimetre shows us a value of 1.5V across the entire battery. Therefore one of our piles gives us around 0.5 Volts. Though, this battery probably won't work in a circuit, since it has a very big internal resistance (the coins and the felt) which means it will have a very low current.
There we go, we have just built a battery just like Alessandro Volta did over 200 years ago!
