# The components
This short chapter aims to show you what components were used in the telegraph and how they work independent from the telegraph. 

## The battery
The battery was invented by Alessandro Volta from Italy in 1800. His invention was called "the Voltaic pile" and we will see why now. 
To understand how every battery works some chemistry is required. In this sub-chapter we will build our own Voltaic pile (first ever working battery) and learn why it works.

#### What you need:
- equally as many copper plates and aluminium or zinc plates. For the copper I used 1 Cent coins and for the Aluminium I used aluminium foil cut into circles the same size as the 1 Cent coins.
- Paper or Felt circles (same size as the coins and foil again). I used felt. 
- Some Water with a teaspoon of Salt in a small cup
- Optional: A plastic tube to keep everything in place

#### Instructions:
First, dip the paper or felt circles into the cup of salt water until they are completely wet. Then lay them out on a paper towl to dry for a bit. They don't need to be dry completely, just let them be for a minute or two until they are only slightly moist. 
Place all the stuff in the following order: Copper, felt, aluminium. And repeat with felt in between until you place your final aluminium or zinc item on top. You should have a "pile" of copper, felt or paper, and aluminium or zinc, in repeating order. 
Now you can take a multimetre and measure the voltage across the battery. I made 3 piles, so I did the order of copper-felt-aluminium 3 times and with that I measured a voltage of about 1.5 Volts.
There we go, we built a battery just like Alessandro Volta did over 200 years ago! 

### How it works
Lets look at the individual components:
Cathode: the copper, 
Anode: the aluminium or Zinc
Electrolyte: The salt water soaked felt

Copper is less precious than Aluminium, as they say in Chemistry. This means that copper doesn't give away electrons as easily as aluminium does. 
The copper coin has the chemical formula: $\text{Cu}^{2+}$ which means it wants to recieve electrons.
The Aluminium foil has the chemical formula: $\text{Al}$ which means it's neutral and can give or recieve electrons. In this connected system therefore Aluminium gives off electrons to Copper. We say that the Aluminium **oxidizes** (because it gives) and Copper **reduces** (beacuse it recieves).
