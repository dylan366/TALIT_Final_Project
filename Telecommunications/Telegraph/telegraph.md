# The Telegraph 
## Introduction
Long distance communication has always been deep in the interest of human civilisation. Weather that was through smoke signals by the Native Americans, drums by African tribes, Running as used by the ancient Greeks, or sending domesticated pigeons like the Romans did, humans have always shown interest in being able to quickly send messages over a long distance within a short period of time. 
The invention of the telegraph system allowed us to send messages over a very long distance within a few seconds. It was also the first device to send messages via electricity. The telegraph is therefore an incredibly important invention in human history, and marks the beginning of long-distance communication through electricity.
## History 
In 1791 the Chappe brothers Claude and Ignace Chappe invented the Chappe telegraph. It was a semaphore, which means it ran through visual symbols that could be seen from afar. The telegraph was purely mechanical and ran through a system of pulleys and gears to change the alignment of 3 iron bars above the tower. The different combination of these iron bars would represent different letters or symbols, and so messages could be sent as far as the horizon allows it. This is of course very simplified and there was a lot more to it, but for the sake of this "electrical" project, it isn't really relevant. Although the functions of the Chappe telegraph and its history are very interesting and worth learning aswell, it isn't importnant for the context of the electrical telegraph. 

The invention of the electric telegraph was allowed due to the increasing amount of scientific discoveries that were being made at the time - especially in the field of electricity and electromagnetism. In 1800 Alessandro Volta of Italy invented the Voltaic cell (Redox Reactions that generate current) which marked the beginning of small batteries. Up to that point, electricity was only created by stored electric outburst like capacitors. Voltas invention created a steady current and supply of electricity, which was perfect for devices that needed a steady power supply - which is most devices.
